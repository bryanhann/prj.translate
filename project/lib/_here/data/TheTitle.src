The following article, which is part of a report on all the Autocephalous
Churches made by Archbishop John to the Second All-Diaspora Sobor of the
Russian Church Abroad held in Yugoslavia in 1938, gives the historical
background of the present state of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
| It could well have been written today, apart from a few small points
which have changed since then. | We reproduce it here to bring more
clarity into the current ecclesiastical crisis surrounding the Ecumenical
Patriarchate and the Ukraine.

The primacy among Orthodox Churches is possessed by the Church of the
New Rome, Constantinople, which is headed by a Patriarch who has the
title of Ecumenical, and therefore is itself called the Ecumenical
Patriarchate, which territorially reached the culmination of its
development at the end of the 18th century. | At that time there was
included in it the whole of Asia Minor, the whole Balkan Peninsula
(except for Montenegro), together with the adjoining islands, since
the other independent Churches in the Balkan Peninsula had been
abolished and had become part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
$
The Ecumenical Patriarch had received from the Turkish Sultan, even
before the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, the title of Millet
Bash, that is, the head of the people, and he was considered the head
of the whole Orthodox population of the Turkish Empire.| This, however,
did not prevent the Turkish government from removing patriarchs for
any reason whatever and calling for new elections, at the same time
collecting a large tax from the newly elected patriarch.
$
Apparently the latter circumstance had a great significance in the
changing of patriarchs by the Turks, and therefore it often happened
that they again allowed on the Patriarchal Throne a patriarch whom
they had removed, after the death of one or several of his successors.
| Thus, many patriarchs occupied their see several times, and each
accession was accompanied by the collection of a special tax from
them by the Turks.
$
In order to make up the sum which he paid on his accession to the
Patriarchal Throne, a patriarch made a collection from the metropolitans
subordinate to him, and they, in their turn, collected from the clergy
subordinate to them. | This manner of making up its finances left an
imprint on the whole order of the Patriarchate's life.
$
In the Patriarchate there was likewise evident the Greek "Great
Idea," that is, the attempt to restore Byzantium, at first in a
cultural, but later also in a political sense. | For this reason
in all important posts there were assigned people loyal to this idea,
and for the most part Greeks from the part of Constantinople called
the Phanar, where also the Patriarchate was located.
$
Almost always the episcopal sees were filled by Greeks, even though
in the Balkan Peninsula the population was primarily Slavic.
