001 '<E>The following article, which is part of a report on all the Autocephalous Churches made by Archbishop John to the Second All-Diaspora Sobor of the Russian Church Abroad held in Yugoslavia in 1938, \n<C>下文出自伊望大主教所作「一切自主教會報告書」。發表於一九三八年、於南斯拉夫舉行、俄羅斯域外教會第二次全體海外流散主教公會議。\n'
002 '<E>gives the historical background of the present state of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. \n<C>此文表達君士坦丁堡牧區、近況之歴史背景。\n'
003 '<E>It could well have been written today, apart from a few small points which have changed since then. We reproduce it here to bring more clarity into the current ecclesiastical crisis surrounding the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Ukraine.\n<C>此文看起來、幾乎是今日寫成。事關牧區當年情況與今日分別不大、獨有幾處相異。而在此重刊、是為叫人認清、今日普世牧區與烏克蘭、所生教會危機。<p>\n'
004 '<E>The primacy among Orthodox Churches is possessed by the Church of the New Rome, Constantinople, \n<C>新羅馬教會（新羅馬即君士坦丁堡）、擁有正教會首席地位。\n'
005 '<E>which is headed by a Patriarch who has the title of Ecumenical, and therefore is itself called the Ecumenical Patriarchate, \n<C>其牧首以「普世」二字為頭銜、故稱普世牧首。\n'
006 '<E>which territorially reached the culmination of its development at the end of the 18th century. \n<C>此牧區於十八世紀末、屬地増廣盛極。\n'
007 '<E>At that time there was included in it the whole of Asia Minor, the whole Balkan Peninsula (except for Montenegro), together with the adjoining islands, \n<C>全盛時期、曽統領小亞西亞全地、巴爾幹半島全地（蒙特內哥羅除外）、以及其他相連島嶼。\n'
008 '<E>since the other independent Churches in the Balkan Peninsula had been abolished and had become part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n<C>事關巴爾幹半島、其他獨立教會、已被廢除、而加入此普世牧區。\n'
009 '<E>The Ecumenical Patriarch had received from the Turkish Sultan, even before the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, the title of Millet Bash, that is, the head of the people,\n<C>其實、在土耳其奪取君士坦丁堡之前、普世牧首已受土耳其蘇丹、賜封為「彌烈波娑」、則人民公首之意。\n'
010 '<E>and he was considered the head of the whole Orthodox population of the Turkish Empire.\n<C>同時亦被視為、土耳其帝國境内、一切正教徒之首。\n'
011 '<E>This, however, did not prevent the Turkish government from removing patriarchs for any reason whatever and calling for new elections,\n<C>此頭銜卻未有使土耳其政府卻歩、反而常常因為各種小事、罷免牧首、而發動選舉。\n'
012 '<E>at the same time collecting a large tax from the newly elected patriarch. \n<C>又於每界新任牧首即位時、徵收大量税金。\n'
013 '<E>Apparently the latter circumstance had a great significance in the changing of patriarchs by the Turks, \n<C>後者明顯影響着土耳其政府、會否更替牧首。此影響甚大。\n'
014 '<E>and therefore it often happened that they again allowed on the Patriarchal Throne a patriarch whom they had removed, after the death of one or several of his successors. \n<C>以至常有牧首、受到罷免、而之後一代以至幾代接任人、盡皆捨壽、他亦能受許、復登牧首寶座。\n'
015 '<E>Thus, many patriarchs occupied their see several times, and each accession was accompanied by the collection of a special tax from them by the Turks.\n<C>故此、有許多牧首、都會重複即位幾次。而每次即位時、土耳其政府都會向牧首收取特別税金。<p>\n'
016 '<E>In order to make up the sum which he paid on his accession to the Patriarchal Throne, a patriarch made a collection from the metropolitans subordinate to him, \n<C>牧首即位、需籌集經費交税、於是就向屬下府主教收錢。\n'
017 '<E>and they, in their turn, collected from the clergy subordinate to them. \n<C>府主教轉過頭來、就向屬下神父收錢。\n'
018 "<E>This manner of making up its finances left an imprint on the whole order of the Patriarchate's life. \n<C>如此籌集經費、深深影響、牧區生活規律。\n"
019 '<E>In the Patriarchate there was likewise evident the Greek "Great Idea," that is, the attempt to restore Byzantium, \n<C>牧區内、亦同様出現一個希臘「好主意」、就是要嘗試復興拜占庭帝國。\n'
020 '<E>at first in a cultural, but later also in a political sense. \n<C>最初祇是要復興其文化、後來亦想復興其政權。\n'
021 '<E>For this reason in all important posts there were assigned people loyal to this idea, \n<C>故而、各個重要區域、都有人受派駐守、以忠於此計。\n'
022 '<E>and for the most part Greeks from the part of Constantinople called the Phanar, where also the Patriarchate was located. \n<C>其中大多都是希臘人、來自君士坦丁堡芬內爾區、即牧首所居之處。\n'
023 '<E>Almost always the episcopal sees were filled by Greeks, even though in the Balkan Peninsula the population was primarily Slavic.\n<C>即使巴爾幹半島民衆、大多都是斯拉夫人、但其境内主教、幾乎全都是希臘人。'
