['The following article, which is part of a report on all the Autocephalous\nChurches made by Archbishop John to the Second All-Diaspora Sobor of the\nRussian Church Abroad held in Yugoslavia in 1938, gives the historical\nbackground of the present state of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n| It could well have been written today, apart from a few small points\nwhich have changed since then. | We reproduce it here to bring more\nclarity into the current ecclesiastical crisis surrounding the Ecumenical\nPatriarchate and the Ukraine.\n', '\nThe primacy among Orthodox Churches is possessed by the Church of the\nNew Rome, Constantinople, which is headed by a Patriarch who has the\ntitle of Ecumenical, and therefore is itself called the Ecumenical\nPatriarchate, which territorially reached the culmination of its\ndevelopment at the end of the 18th century. | At that time there was\nincluded in it the whole of Asia Minor, the whole Balkan Peninsula\n(except for Montenegro), together with the adjoining islands, since\nthe other independent Churches in the Balkan Peninsula had been\nabolished and had become part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n', '\nThe Ecumenical Patriarch had received from the Turkish Sultan, even\nbefore the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, the title of Millet\nBash, that is, the head of the people, and he was considered the head\nof the whole Orthodox population of the Turkish Empire.| This, however,\ndid not prevent the Turkish government from removing patriarchs for\nany reason whatever and calling for new elections, at the same time\ncollecting a large tax from the newly elected patriarch.\n', '\nApparently the latter circumstance had a great significance in the\nchanging of patriarchs by the Turks, and therefore it often happened\nthat they again allowed on the Patriarchal Throne a patriarch whom\nthey had removed, after the death of one or several of his successors.\n| Thus, many patriarchs occupied their see several times, and each\naccession was accompanied by the collection of a special tax from\nthem by the Turks.\n', "\nIn order to make up the sum which he paid on his accession to the\nPatriarchal Throne, a patriarch made a collection from the metropolitans\nsubordinate to him, and they, in their turn, collected from the clergy\nsubordinate to them. | This manner of making up its finances left an\nimprint on the whole order of the Patriarchate's life.\n", '\nIn the Patriarchate there was likewise evident the Greek "Great\nIdea," that is, the attempt to restore Byzantium, at first in a\ncultural, but later also in a political sense. | For this reason\nin all important posts there were assigned people loyal to this idea,\nand for the most part Greeks from the part of Constantinople called\nthe Phanar, where also the Patriarchate was located.\n', '\nAlmost always the episcopal sees were filled by Greeks, even though\nin the Balkan Peninsula the population was primarily Slavic.\n']
